# Unofficial Commit 2018

Unofficial Commit 2018 companion app.

The app is a proof of concept of an agenda for the Conference. It only contains the titles of the talks but can be the basis of an app to manage big conferences with a lot of tracks.

The user can add talks to "My Track" for easy management of his/her own agenda.
